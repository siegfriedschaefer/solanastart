# solanastart

This repository serves as a starting point for react-native based developments on solana.
It is based on https://github.com/solana-developers/dapp-scaffold-react-native.

Since I haven't managed to setup a working project with the react-native typescript template cli 8.0.6 and the
solana cookbook documentation for one week, i will take this scaffold for now, which works out of the box.

## Statusupdate
2022/08/20 - Please do not waste your time with setting up a react-native project and the solana cookbook documentation.
